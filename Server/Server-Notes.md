# Server
The Server is used for when someone wants to by a plot and the plot needs to be
hosted on a **Server**. The Server can be anything, perferbly something that dosn't
stop running or something that your not going to turn off for a long time. The
Server will handle the all of the cliants connected to it. The generation will
be handled by the *Block Chain*. This is so that no one can generate the plot on
there own, so that the plot is secure. 

## What Dose the Server Need to Do
The Server needs to handle all of the cliants on the Server. So, that means handling
- Cliants Position
- Cliants Actions
- Cliants Items
- Sending Transactions

When entering into a *Dongen* The Server need to handle more the just the cliants.
The Server also needs to handle:
- Entitys/Mobs
- Loot Transactions
- Dongen Generation Transaction.
- Level/Difficolty

## Transactions on the Plot 
The transactions are not happening on the plot is only giving the smart contract
the corect data to make the transaction happen. So if the transactions require a 
certen item or items, the player and the Server both send a contract to see if 
they match. If the servers contract and the players contract match the transaction
is made. 
*The Plot owner will get a certen cut of the transaction.*

### Merchents
The Merchents are an *NPC* that do trading for you. On a plot of land you can trad 
and buy items but, the owner has to do all of the trading. In other words the 
owner has to make all the trades himself if he was trying to sell his bread.
what Merchents do is allow the player to buy the items from the Merchent insted
of the player. So the player dosn't have to be there to make the trade. *The only
down side of having a Merchent is that it will take a certen persentage of the 
sale.*
